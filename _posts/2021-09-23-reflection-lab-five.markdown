# Reflection on Lab 5

This lab was easier to me because there was less hard coding. However, I think that I need to get practice maniupulating the back-ends of SQL before I can have confidence in it. The flowcharts and schema were quite useful for organizing my thoughts and it was useful to think in those terms during my meeting with our client. I'm excited to get to put these ideas into practice as we work on our own websites. 

In the meeting with Holly Payne, I was able to use some experience I had working with a homerigged delivery system back in Atlanta. I'll be able to follow up with my old contacts about how they were able to get their website to work. 

Here's the SQL Schema:

And here's the lucid chart:
