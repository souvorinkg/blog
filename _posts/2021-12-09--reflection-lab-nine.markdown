# Reflection on Lab 9

Lab nine did not go well for our group. I was able to get through the first part of creating production databases, but I got stuck when trying to combine dotnet tools with the azure portal. Unfortanutely, I was not able to be present for many days during the lab because I was in a conference in Chicago for another class. Luckily for our project, the website we built was designed to be locally hosted, so we were not relying on azure hosting for our final project. However, it is still unfortanute that we weren't able to complete it.
