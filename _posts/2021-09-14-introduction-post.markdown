print("Before this lab, I had never used the terminal in a computer before. While I had been limited to a chromebook for previous labs, my dad lent me his mac for the semester. Initially, I really struggled with the terminal because I had some strange commands line errors for software I didn't have to download the project. However, I was able to find an alternate path to getting ruby through a site Dr. Goadrich found here: https://nickymarino.com/2020/06/13/jekyll-server-rvm-macos/.")
