# Reflection on Lab 4

This was the lab I felt the most comfortable with. I am completely new to Jekyll and working with a terminal, so this part took alot of work. I struggled finding where my gem files were, but once I found out how to use the terminal better and download and find gems, the project became much easier. It was also a struggle learning the structure of a jekyll page, but it makes more sense now. I'm still not sur how to make better links, I'd like to have direct link in my nav bar without the use of other pages. I'm looking forward to how good this site is going to look by the end of the semester! I was able to get alot of answers through [this tutorial](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/jekyll-pages-novice/aio/index.html) and [this jekyll theme guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).

Blog goals this week
1. Get better at links in nav bar
2. Get nav bar links to be on all pages
3. Add new themes and styling
