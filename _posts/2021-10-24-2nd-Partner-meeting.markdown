# 2nd Parter Meeting

Holly Payne reacted positively to our moqups and schemas outlining how we wanted to design the webiste. We were able to answer questions about the delivery route calculator implementation, which she previously did through the OptimoRoute app and we plan on doing through OptimoRoute's API. We described our plan of using APIs, and populating databases through the csvs we had access to. Holly has had some coding and website building experience, but she had never worked with a database before, so explianing that aspect was key. The meeting went well and we now have approval on our concrete plan for the semester.
