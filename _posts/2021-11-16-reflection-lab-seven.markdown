# Reflection on Lab 7

The easiest parts of the tutorial were sections 7 and 8, as I was getting ore comfortable using visual studio at this point. It made sense how to update a page across different files. the beginning section was incredibly confusing and took me the longest amount of time, as I didn't know how to operate a powershell or cmd line tool effectively, and I didn't understand how to set up a visual studio project. while I did finish the tutorial, I didn't have enought time to create a new application in step 2. both Jekyll and Razor used lots of scaffolding to set up large parts of the website for me. Additionally, the both used the command line to take care of tasks. They also both used multiple languages to address different problems. I'm already starting on lab 8 and I feel more confident already.
