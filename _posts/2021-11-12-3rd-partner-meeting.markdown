# 3rd Partner Meeting

For the first time to Holly, we were able to demonstrate hard code on how the website was to look. She had approved of Moqup and Schema in the past. We were able to show the scaffolded bare bones pages on the site. Additionally, our database was built and populated with customer informtation, so we were able to demonstrate it's capabilities to her. We showed her how to perform queries to find customers and order times. The meeting was again positive and we are prepared to finish the site and make our final changes.
