# Reflection on Lab 8

This lab took alot of work, but I felt much more confident in my troubleshootng abilities developed from the previous labs. The easiest section was updated the database. The hardest section was the begginning, as I strggled to build the projext until I found some guidance on stackoverflow. At first I was confused, as I was following steps I didn't need to and struggling to get my terminal to work. Multiple tables was actually a really logical extension of the concepts we worked on in class, and I'm excited to put the ideas from this lab into practice. I feel that I have the tools to create this team project.
